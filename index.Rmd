# Introduction

Welcome to our website. We used the NYC dogs database for our final project. We wanted to understand dog breeds across the 5 boroughs of NYC: Manhattan, Queens, The Bronx, Brooklyn, and Staten Island.

# Dataset

We utilized the NYC Dog Licensing dataset. All dog owners who reside in the five boroughs of New York City are required by law to license their dogs. Licenses can range from one to five years.  The dataset is publicly available and sourced from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) Dog Licensing System where owners are able to apply for and renew dog licenses. This dataset was created on September 19, 2017 and was last updated on July 25, 2019. There are 10 variables in this dataset with a raw number of 345,727 observations

# Findings

1. Manhattan had the highest population of dogs, however the age of the dogs' was pretty evenly distributed across the boroughs.
2. There were more male than female dogs across all five boroughs.
3. A pattern was noted in the times where dog licesnes are issued: the warmer spring and summer months and in December seem to be the peak times.
4. Max, Charlie and Bella, were the most popular dog names among the licensed dogs, and are continually growing in popularity.
5. There is not much variance across the predicted ages of the dogs by borough, adjusting for gender of the dog.
